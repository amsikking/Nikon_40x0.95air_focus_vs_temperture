# Nikon_40x0.95air_focus_vs_temperture
Data showing how the focal plane of a Nikon 40x0.95 air objective moves axially with temperature.

## Result:
The focal plane of a Nikon 40x0.95 air objective (MRD00405) moves axially with temperature at a linear rate of **~1.58um/degC**. The parfocal length (flange to image plane) is ~60.06mm, which gives a coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) of
**~26.4e-6/K**. For reference, typical values of CLTE are ~10-17 for stainless steel, ~18-19 for brass and 21-24 for aluminium (e-6/K).
